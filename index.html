	<div id="description">Open Brewery DB is a free API for public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops. Currently it is focused to the United States. </div> 
	<br>
	<div id="citation">I found this API at https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ </div> 
	<br>
	<div id="options">I queried using the by_city=boston option in the API request. </div> 
	<br>
	<div id="applications">This API would be helpful if you want some beer but you're tired of your usual beer, so you decide to explore some nearby breweries. You can query by_city, by_state, by_type, and by_tag. This will tell you everything you need to know about your brewery options, and will even let you know if the brewery is dog friendly so you can bring along your pup! </div>
